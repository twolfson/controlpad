# DEV: We are building a state machine

# I work on an extended side by side desktop (totalling 3840x1080)
# When I push ctrl+alt+host+right
  # If the focused window is on the right half of the first monitor
    # Move it to the left half of the second monitor
  # If it is on the second monitor
    # Move it to the right half of the second monitor
  # Otherwise
    # Move it to the right half of the first monitor

# TODO: Determine how to get window state

# If we anticipate chaining (very likely), we need to figure out how to build a persistent action stack (e.g. pushd/popd)

# These will probably be other bin's to simplify files (e.g. wmpush, wmpop)

# For modularity's sake, we will want to make chaining a user specified action
<<<EXAMPLE1
# Moves across desktops in half-panes
controlpad 'leftmost right-half' 'rightmost left-half' 'rightmost right-half'

# Toggles between quarter and eighth of current desktop
controlpad 'current top-right-quarter' 'current top-right-eighth'
EXAMPLE1

# This example clarifies things, we will have an optional scope as the first portion of each parameter
# TODO: If that is too complicated, require two scopes with `all` being entire desktop
