# DEV: We are building a state machine

# I work on an extended side by side desktop (totalling 3840x1080)
# When I push ctrl+alt+host+right
  # If the focused window is on the right half of the first monitor
    # Move it to the left half of the second monitor
  # If it is on the second monitor
    # Move it to the right half of the second monitor
  # Otherwise
    # Move it to the right half of the first monitor

# TODO: Determine how to get window state

# If we anticipate chaining (very likely), we need to figure out how to build a persistent action stack (e.g. pushd/popd)
